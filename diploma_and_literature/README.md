This directory contains diploma, presentation, "Literature" directory and some files generated durind tests<br />
results.txt has calculated by PBF, ISA, OLS minimal height for every test<br />
res_H_for_PBF_ISA_OLS.txt has average minimal height found by these algorithms given 2 seconds to solve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(first three lines - guillotine cut, last two - nonguillotine cut)<br />
res_PBF_&_Pack_vs_Heur.txt has computational tests for PBF and FindHeuristicSequence (both are heuristics)<br />

PBF stands for Priority Best Fit, main heuristic algorithm<br />
ISA stands for Intelligent Simulated Annealing, main metaheuristic algorithm<br />
OLS stands for Only Local Search, where Local Search is a part of ISA<br />
