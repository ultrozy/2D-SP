The family of test kits includes tests containing 25, 50 and 100 rectangles, obtained by guillotine cut and non-guillotine cut.<br />
Each test kit has 100 problems.<br />

For all tests containing 25 rectangles, the optimal height is 24.<br />
For all tests containing 50 rectangles, the optimal height is 30.<br />
For all tests containing 100 rectangles, the optimal height is 60.<br />

Format:
First line: two numbers W and N corresponding to the width of the strip and the number of rectangles.<br />
Each of the next N lines: width and height of the corresponding rectangle.<br />

P.S. nonguil25 tests are bugged.<br />
